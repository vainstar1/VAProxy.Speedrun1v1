# VAProxy.Speedrun1v1
This is a mod that takes heavy inspiration from [this mod](https://github.com/MCSR-Ranked). No source code for now as this will be refined with environment variables so my server doesn't get ddos'ed lol.
# How It Works
When you load into the main menu, pressing Ctrl + K places you in a queue by sending data to a server via webhooks. If another player queues while you're in the queue, a match is formed, triggering a 3-second countdown. Afterward, both clients will load into the game on a fresh save that won't be accessible after returning to the main menu. Current version does not have many features, but will be heavily expanded upon as I find the time to work on this mod. These features include:
* Public/Private lobby creation
* Live feedback on what stage your opponent is at
* Several UI additions to make the mod seamless
* Different routes to play (all bosses, any%, etc)
* Leaderboards and elo system (maybe.... if the community gets big enough)
* Anti-cheat (again, if the community gets big enough)
